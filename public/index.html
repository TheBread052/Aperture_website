                <h2>History of Aperture Science Laboratories</h2>

                <h4>1940s</h4>

                <p>
                    Aperture Science began humbly in 1940 when our founder, Cave Johnson, set out to make the world’s finest shower curtains under the name <em>Aperture Curtain</em>.  
                    Because nothing says “innovation” like waterproof fabric.
                    In 1944, Cave purchased the Michigan salt mine — not because he liked salt, but because it was big, empty, and perfect for building a secret underground research facility.
                    By 1947, <em>Aperture Science Innovators</em> was born, and immediately became embroiled in a healthy, definitely-not-personal rivalry with <em style="color: red;">Black Mesa</em>, a lesser military corporation.
                </p>

                <br>

                alt="Black Mesa logo" 
                title="Black Mesa logo"/>

                <p><em>Our sworn enemies (and also terrible people).</em></p>

                <br><br>

                <h4>1970s</h4>

                <p>
                    The company’s reputation in scientific research grew rapidly. Inside the salt mine, we built a state-of-the-art research and experimentation center — now extending over 2.5 miles underground!  
                    In this golden era, we invented legendary technologies like Repulsion Gel and, of course, the <em>Portal Gun</em>.  
                    Meanwhile, Cave Johnson’s projects became increasingly… creative. “Bold.” Some would even say “dangerously stupid.” But that’s what makes progress!
                </p>

                <br>

                <h4>Quote from Cave Johnson:</h4>

                <p>
                    "When life gives you lemons? Don’t make lemonade. Make life take the lemons back!  
                    Get mad! ‘I don’t want your damn lemons! What am I supposed to do with these?’  
                    Demand to see life’s manager! Make life rue the day it thought it could give Cave Johnson lemons!  
                    Do you know who I am? I’m the man who’s gonna burn your house down! With the lemons!  
                    I’m gonna get my engineers to invent a combustible lemon that burns your house down!"
                </p>

                <br>

                <h4>1980–1990</h4>

                <p>
                    After the unfortunate (and completely unforeseeable) death of Cave Johnson, Aperture Science rebranded as <em>Aperture Science Laboratories</em>.
                    This era gave birth to one of our proudest achievements: the <em>Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System</em>, better known as GLaDOS.  
                    The plan? Upload the brilliant mind of Caroline, Cave’s loyal assistant, into a super-intelligent AI to run the entire facility.  
                    What could possibly go wrong?
                </p>

                <br>

                <h4>2000 – ?</h4>

                <p>
                    As it turns out — everything.  
                    GLaDOS took full control of the facility and, on “Bring Your Cat to Work Day”, introduced neurotoxin to the entire building.  
                    Her reasoning: “For science.”  
                    While official reports list zero survivors, rumours persist that a few unlucky individuals are still wandering the test chambers to this day.

                    <br><br>

                    And so, testing continues. Forever.
