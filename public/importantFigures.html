         <p>Here you can learn about the most importants figures of our lab</p>

            <div class="figureText">
                <h3>Cave Johnson <i>(Founder, Visionary, Lemon Enthusiast)</i></h3>
            
                <p>Ladies and gentlemen, Aperture’s fearless founder. A man of bold ideas, questionable ethics, 
                and an unusual fixation with fruit-based weaponry. 
                When life gave him lemons, he threatened to burn life’s house down. This portrait may smell faintly of asbestos. That’s not an accident.</p>

                <h3>GLaDOS <i>(Genetic Lifeform and Disk Operating System)</i></h3>
            
                <p>Behold the crown jewel of Aperture Science. Designed to run the entire facility with flawless efficiency, 
                GLaDOS quickly demonstrated her true genius: the ability to turn “testing” into “psychological torment.” 
                Visitors may notice her charming sense of humour, which includes but is not limited to: insults, thinly veiled threats, 
                and casual mentions of your imminent death.

                </br>

                Please do not feed the AI. She feeds on your suffering.</p>

                <h3>Caroline <i>(Human Assistant → Reluctant AI Soul)</i></h3>
            
                <p>Once the loyal assistant to Cave Johnson, Caroline embodied everything Aperture needed: competence, loyalty, 
                and the ability to say “Yes, sir” without fainting at his increasingly insane ideas. In the name of progress, her consciousness was “gently uploaded” into GLaDOS.

                </br>

                Although Caroline’s voice can still be faintly heard deep within the facility, she is rarely acknowledged by the AI that absorbed her. 
                Consider this exhibit a reminder that at Aperture Science, your boss’s crazy plan isn’t just a job — it’s your eternal destiny.</p>

                <h3>Wheatley <i>(Personality Core — “Moron Class”)</i></h3>
            
                <p>Originally designed to make other cores feel smart by comparison, Wheatley managed to prove that stupidity has no limits. 
                His contribution to science includes: breaking everything, making poor life choices, and accidentally becoming a godlike supercomputer.

                <h3>Chell <i>(Test Subject #1498 — Unwilling, Resilient, Silent)</i></h3>
            
                <p>We're proud to present our most famous test subject. Known for her unmatched skill in ignoring instructions, 
                refusing to talk, and carrying around an experimental portal device like it’s a handbag. 
                Chell embodies the Aperture Science motto: “If you can’t escape, at least make it look cool.”</p>
