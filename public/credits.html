        <p><em>This is a student-made fan project inspired by Portal (Valve Corporation).

        <h3>Why this project?</h3>

        <p>I'm a huge fan of the Portal universe and the strange stories told in <u>Portal</u> and <u>Portal 2</u> by Valve.
            Since I am studying computer science (more specifically software and mobile application development) at the French university "Marie et Louis Pasteur" in Belfort,
            I designed this website both as a tribute to my favorite universe and as a portfolio I can present to professionals.
            <br/>
            You can see this website as a mix of all my passions: programming, science, and video games!
        </p>

        <h3>My interaction with Valve</h3>

        <p>As I do not own the rights to the Portal games or their universe, I researched Valve's legal mentions to ensure I was allowed to make this project.
            Valve is generally open to fan-made projects, as long as they are not sold for profit and do not directly reuse in-game assets.
            To be sure of what I could do, I also contacted Steam's customer support (a platform created by Valve) to ask if I was allowed to create what this project has become.
            Here is my email and their response:
            <br/>
            <img src="png_files/Steam.png"
                alt="Mail from Steam"
                title="Mail from Steam"/>
        </p>

        <br/>

        <p>Thank you for visiting my website, I hope you had fun! As soon as possible, I will upload a local version of the project to GitHub so you can explore how everything works.
            Once it is ready, this link: <a href="index.html" target="_blank">GitHub link</a>, will be active.
